Pandas HW
Analysis:

Observations from the analysis. Small schools and charter schools have higher percentages of students who pass math and reading overall. Larger student body
schools struggle with math. The charter and district schools both have a good variety of small, medium and large student populations. Also, surprisingly, 
school spending did not equate to better scores. One might, in error, assume that the more you spend on a student, the better they might perform. This 
did not end being accurate. Smaller schools may simply have a better way of managing and tarcking students, regardless of budgets, thus leading to student
success. Also, looking at scores by grade, the schools are pretty consistent. Under performing schools are typically this way in all grades. One grade does not seem 
to do better than another. The bottom performing schools were all district schools while the top performing schools were all charter schools.

Thus, charter schools and smaller student body size may lead to better performance as measure by math and reading scores on average.
